# SSH Client/Server example with Go

## Initialization

To setup a SSH server, a host ssh keypair (usually RSA) has to be created, to do so, run:

```
bash init.sh
```

Those files should have been created in the project directory:

* `./host_key`
* `./host_key.pub`

## Simple client usage

```
go run client.go <user> <server:port> <command>
```

Example:

```
â””> go run client.go foobar example.com:22 'ls /'
Password: *********

boot
conf.d
dev

initrd.img
lib
